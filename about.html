        <p class="about-text">
          At Merrill DS, we believe that every business—whether it’s a brand-new
          startup or an established company—deserves a powerful online presence.
          That’s why we set out to become the go-to digital services partner for
          companies of all sizes. Our mission is simple: help you strengthen
          your online reach, connect with more customers, and ultimately become
          more profitable through a stronger presence on the web.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          We offer an all-in-one suite of digital services to build and grow
          your online presence. Our team specializes in creating custom-coded
          websites from scratch (no templates), optimizing your site for search
          engines (SEO) to get you noticed, setting up your Google Business
          profile for better local visibility, and creating and managing your
          social media accounts to engage your audience. Beyond that, we provide
          other tailored solutions to meet your business’s unique needs—ensuring
          every aspect of your online presence is covered. If you can dream it,
          we <b>WILL</b> build it. No project is too big or too small.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          What sets Merrill DS apart is our genuine, personal approach. When you
          work with us, you’re not just another client—you’re a partner, and we
          treat your goals as our own. We take the time to understand your
          business and build real relationships, because your success is what
          motivates us. Unlike companies that focus purely on the bottom line,
          we find genuine satisfaction in helping your business grow. When you
          succeed, we succeed—and that philosophy drives everything we do. When
          we meet, we dont call it a consultation, we call it a meeting. We want
          to get to know you and your business, and we want you to get to know
          us. We want to be your partner in your online success.
