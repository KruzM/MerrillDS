        <h2>Nuvia Directory</h2>
        <p>
          This project involved building a fully custom internal website and
          resource directory for the lab division of a multi-million dollar
          dental implant company. Developed in Zoho Creator, the platform was
          designed to centralize tools, documents, and daily resources needed by
          employees across multiple lab locations. A key feature of this build
          was a custom Location Verification System developed in-house. This
          security measure authenticated users based on their physical location,
          ensuring compliance with internal policies by restricting access to
          authorized zones only.

        <h2>CCL Pro</h2>
        <p>
          In 2025, we completed a comprehensive digital presence package for a
          local landscaping company. This included a fully custom-coded website
          designed from the ground up to match the client’s specific vision and
          brand identity. The project also featured in-depth SEO optimization,
          helping the business rank higher in local search results and attract
          new leads organically. Additionally, we handled a complete social
          media setup—creating and branding accounts across major platforms,
          optimizing bios and contact links, and developing a content strategy
          to help the client engage with their community. Since launch, the
          project has proven to be a strong success, driving increased
          visibility, customer inquiries, and overall growth for the client.
